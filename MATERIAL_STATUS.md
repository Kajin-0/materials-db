**Notes:**
- Items marked with `[x]` should have a working detail page.
- Items marked with `[ ]` do not yet have an entry in `material_details.json` and clicking their card will likely lead to an error page.
- `(Note: Key in details might be different)` indicates the name used in the simple `materials-*.json` might differ slightly from the key used in `material_details.json`. The check performed here used the keys *currently present* in the provided `material_details.json`. You may need to adjust keys or add aliases if clicks aren't working for these.
