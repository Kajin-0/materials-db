    "description": "Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe or MCT) is a II-VI semiconductor alloy where the bandgap, and thus the optical/electrical properties, are precisely tuned by adjusting the Cadmium mole fraction (x). Values typically range from x=0 (HgTe, semimetal) to x=1 (CdTe, ~1.5eV bandgap). It is widely used in high-performance infrared sensors and thermal imaging systems, especially those requiring cryogenic cooling. The preferred substrate for highest quality epitaxial growth is often lattice-matched Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) with approximately 4% Zn concentration.",
    "safety": {
      "toxicity": "High. Contains Mercury (neurotoxin, heavy metal) and Cadmium (carcinogen). Elemental Tellurium is also toxic.",
      "handling": "Requires specialized handling under strict protocols: Use appropriate PPE (nitrile gloves, safety glasses, respirator if generating dust/fumes), work only in certified fume hoods or glove boxes. Follow designated hazardous waste disposal procedures."

      "lattice_constant": {
        "value": "~6.461 Å (for x=0, HgTe) to ~6.481 Å (for x=1, CdTe)",
        "notes": "Varies nearly linearly with x (Vegard's Law applies approximately)."
      },
      "phase_diagram_notes": "Pseudo-binary system. Solidus-liquidus gap is narrow, especially near x=0.2, influencing LPE melt stability and MBE/MOCVD stoichiometry control. Understanding Hg partial pressure is critical."
    },
    "growth_fabrication_properties": {
      "common_growth_methods": "LPE (from Te-rich melts, lower temps ~450-500 C), MBE (precise control, lower temps ~180-210 C, elemental or compound sources), MOCVD (higher temps ~350-400 C, requires stable Hg precursor like DIPT or DMHg).",
      "source_materials_purity": "High-purity elemental sources: Mercury (Hg, often 6N-7N+), Cadmium (Cd, 6N-7N+), Tellurium (Te, 6N-7N+). CdTe compound source also used. Purity (typically >6N) is critical for low defect density and long carrier lifetimes.",
      "preferred_substrates_orientations": "Substrate: CdZnTe (~4% Zn) for best lattice matching. Si, GaAs, Ge, Sapphire also used with buffer layers (CdTe common). Orientations: (111)B [Te-face] for LPE; (211)B and (100) common for MBE/MOCVD for smoother morphology and reduced defects.",
      "typical_growth_parameters": "Highly dependent on method and 'x'. MBE/MOCVD rates typically 1-5 um/hr. Precise temperature control (+/-0.1 C) and Hg flux/pressure management are vital for composition and defect control.",
      "passivation_methods": "Essential for stability and reducing surface recombination. Common materials: Deposited ZnS, CdTe (often in-situ), or SiO2. Methods: Sputtering, e-beam evaporation, MBE, MOCVD, ALD. Choice depends on device architecture and operating conditions."
    },
    "post_growth_processing": {
      "annealing": "CRITICAL step. Typically performed after growth or device processing. Purposes: Reduce Hg vacancies (often acceptor defects), activate p-type dopants (like As), improve crystallinity. Conditions: Temperatures range ~200-450 C depending on purpose and 'x'. Strict control of Hg overpressure is mandatory to prevent Hg loss and maintain stoichiometry. Annealing times vary (hours to days).",
      "lapping_polishing": "Used for substrate preparation or thinning. Lapping: Alumina (Al2O3) or Silicon Carbide (SiC) slurries. Polishing: Fine diamond slurries (e.g., <1 um) or chemo-mechanical polishing (CMP) with solutions like Br-Methanol on specialized pads (e.g., polyurethane). Material is brittle, requires low pressure.",
      "etching": "Wet Etching: Br-Methanol (various concentrations, fast, isotropic), Br-Ethylene Glycol (slower, more controlled), Lactic/Nitric/HF mixes (polishing etches). Dry Etching: Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) or Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) using methane/hydrogen (CH4/H2), Ar, or halogen-based chemistries for device patterning.",
      "grinding_milling": "Generally avoided due to brittleness and contamination risks for device wafers. May be used carefully for source material preparation (e.g., crushing bulk CdTe) but requires specialized equipment and cleaning."
