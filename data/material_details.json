    "description": "Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe or MCT) is a II-VI semiconductor alloy where the bandgap, and thus the optical/electrical properties, are precisely tuned by adjusting the Cadmium mole fraction (x). Values typically range from x=0 (HgTe, semimetal) to x=1 (CdTe, ~1.5eV bandgap). It is widely used in high-performance infrared sensors and thermal imaging systems, especially those requiring cryogenic cooling. The preferred substrate for highest quality epitaxial growth is often lattice-matched Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe or CZT) with approximately 4% Zn concentration.",
    "safety": {
      "toxicity": "High. Contains Mercury (neurotoxin, heavy metal) and Cadmium (carcinogen). Elemental Tellurium is also toxic.",
