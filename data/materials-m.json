    "description": "Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe or MCT) is a II-VI semiconductor alloy known for its tunable bandgap, enabling detection across SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR bands. It is widely used in infrared sensors and thermal imaging systems, especially in cryogenically cooled applications.",

    "safety": {
      "toxicity": "High. Contains Mercury (toxic heavy metal) and Cadmium (carcinogen). Elemental Tellurium is also toxic.",
      "handling": "Requires specialized handling: Use appropriate PPE (gloves, respirator if generating dust/fumes), work in well-ventilated areas or fume hoods. Follow strict waste disposal protocols."
